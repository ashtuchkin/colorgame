Color game
==========
This is a humble browser-based multiplayer game aimed to learn node.js/socket.io and amuse audience.

Gameplay
--------
Click on the cells to make your own army the same color. Who has the most cells in the end - wins.    
Someone called this game a 'virus', but I haven't found any confirmations. If you have, please tell me.


Technologies
------------

* A basic Node.js/Express/EJS web server.
* Socket.IO for realtime communication.
* Facebook authentication.
* No database (yet).

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repo
2. Edit config.js (especially, siteUrl & appId/appSecret)
3. Run it: node index.js

Even more convenient is to use [Cloud9 Ide](http://c9.io/).
